# My configs for Gentoo's package manager, Portage.
Everything in my portage folder, for personal use.

There are not meant to be examples for your own configs, they are messy and not optimally configured! 
Be sure to check the [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page) to learn about Gentoo Linux.
